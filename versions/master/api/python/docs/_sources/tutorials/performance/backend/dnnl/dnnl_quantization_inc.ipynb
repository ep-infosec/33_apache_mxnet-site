    "# Improving accuracy with Intel® Neural Compressor\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of a model can decrease as a result of quantization. When the accuracy drop is significant, we can try to manually find a better quantization configuration (exclude some layers, try different calibration methods, etc.), but for bigger models this might prove to be a difficult and time consuming task. [Intel® Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) (INC) tries to automate this process using several tuning heuristics, which aim to find the quantization configuration that satisfies the specified accuracy requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most tuning strategies will try different configurations on an evaluation dataset in order to find out how each layer affects the accuracy of the model. This means that for larger models, it may take a long time to find a solution (as the tuning space is usually larger and the evaluation itself takes longer).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install MXNet with oneDNN enabled as described in the [Get started](https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/master/get_started?platform=linux&language=python&processor=cpu&environ=pip&). (Until the 2.0 release you can use the nightly build version: `pip install --pre mxnet -f https://dist.mxnet.io/python`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install Intel® Neural Compressor:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Use one of the commands below to install INC (supported python versions are: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9):\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  # install stable version from pip\n",

    "\n",
    "  # install stable version from conda\n",
    "  conda install neural-compressor -c conda-forge -c intel\n",

You can also add your own strategy if the existing ones do not suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the value of `timeout` in the example above is 0, INC will run until it finds a configuration that satisfies the accuracy criterion and then exit. Depending on the strategy this may not be ideal, as sometimes it would be better to further explore the tuning space to find a superior configuration both in terms of accuracy and speed. To achieve this, we can set a specific `timeout` value, which will tell INC how long (in seconds) it should run.\n",
