    "# Exporting to ONNX format\n",
    "\n",
    "[Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) provides an open source format for AI models. It defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of built-in operators and standard data types. In the MXNet 1.9 release, the MXNet-to-ONNX export module (mx2onnx) has received a major update with new features such as dynamic input shapes and better operator and model coverages. Please visit the [ONNX Export Support for MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/v1.x/python/mxnet/onnx#onnx-export-support-for-mxnet) page for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the mx2onnx exporter on pre-trained models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tutorial we will need to have installed the following python modules:\n",
    "- [MXNet >= 1.9.0](/get_started) _OR_ an earlier MXNet version + [the mx2onnx wheel](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/v1.x/python/mxnet/onnx#installation)\n",
    "- [onnx >= 1.7.0](https://github.com/onnx/onnx#installation)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* The latest mx2onnx exporting module is tested with ONNX op set version 12 or later, which corresponds to ONNX version 1.7 or later. Use of ealier ONNX versions may still work on some simple models, but again this is not tested."
