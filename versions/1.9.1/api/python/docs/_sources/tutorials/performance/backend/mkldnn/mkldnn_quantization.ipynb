This script is  integrated with [Gluon-CV modelzoo](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/model_zoo/classification.html), so that all pre-trained models can be downloaded from Gluon-CV and then converted for quantization. For details, you can refer [Model Quantization with Calibration Examples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/quantization/README.md).\n",

If you're using Gluon, you can first refer [Saving and Loading Gluon Models](/api/python/docs/tutorials/packages/gluon/blocks/save_load_params.html) to hybridize your computation graph and export it as a symbol before running quantization.\n",

    "In general, the quantization flow includes 4 steps. The user can get the acceptable accuracy from step 1 to 3 with minimum effort. Most of thing in this stage is out-of-box and the data scientists and researchers only need to focus on how to represent data and layers in their model. After a quantized model is generated, you may want to deploy it online and the performance will be the next key point. Thus, step 4, calibration, can improve the performance a lot by reducing lots of runtime calculation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The accuracy of a model can decrease as a result of quantization. When the accuracy drop is significant, we can try to manually find a better quantization configuration (exclude some layers, try different calibration methods, etc.), but for bigger models this might prove to be a difficult and time consuming task. [Intel® Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) (INC) tries to automate this process using several tuning heuristics, which aim to find the quantization configuration that satisfies the specified accuracy requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most tuning strategies will try different configurations on an evaluation dataset in order to find out how each layer affects the accuracy of the model.
